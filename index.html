    <h4 id="skateboarding" class="subtitle">SKATEBOARDING</h4>
      <h5>history</h5>
        <p>In the 1950’s California surfers attached roller skate wheels to wooden planks to create the first skateboards. Inspired by crate scooters and surfboards, skateboards were a fun alternative to surfing when the waves were too calm. As skateboarding gained popularity, surf manufacturers began producing boards and sponsoring skate teams. Makaha’s founder, Larry Stevenson, hosted the first skateboarding competition in 1963 in Hermosa Beach, CA. These competitions had two components—flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing. Skaters went without shoes and wore white tank tops and shorts and performed tricks that were heavily inspired by gymnastics and dancing.</p>
        <p>In the mid-70’s the Zephyr team, hailing from Santa Monica, disrupted the competition scene both in style and attitude. This legendary team, the subject of the documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys and the inspiration for the show The Lords of Dogtown, included prolific skaters such as Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Peggy Oki and Stacy Peralta. The Zephyr team revolutionized skateboarding both as a sport and a culture—they dominated competitions with Hawaiian surf-inspired maneuvers and formed a cult following based on their free spirited approach. In addition, the Z-Boys are also credited with birth of vertical skating (discovered by trespassing into drained swimming pools), which led to the rise of many other extreme sports such as BMX biking and rollerblading. As the young members of the Zephyr team received more and more sponsorship offer, it was impossible to keep the team together ultimately leading to its disbandment in 1976.</p>
        <p>One of the members of the Zephyr team, Stacy Peralta, rose to success as one of the top ranked skaters of the 70s. He later founded Powell Peralta (with engineer George Powell) and more importantly the skateboarding team the Bones Brigade. This team, made up of multiple skaters under the age of 15, included famous skaters such as Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, Tommy Guerrero, Rodney Mullen and Brandon Novak. Many of these young skaters specialized in either vert ramp tricks or street skating, influencing the styles of skating that would dominate much of the 1990’s and 2000’s. The 1986 skateboarding movie, Thrashin’, features many members of the Bones Brigade and is credited with popularizing skateboarding amongst the larger public. While Thrashin’ inspired many young amateurs, other skateboarding films of the time, like Video Days spread the image of skateboarders as reckless rebels. Today, some skateboard publications still portray skateboarding as heavily tied to punk/rebel-culture, while other sources aim to redefine this image. Historically, this tension within skateboard culture has led to community opposition of skatepark construction and hosting competitions. Today, there are many initiatives, like the International Association of Skateboard Companies and Boston-based Keep Kids Off the Streets, that have started to promote skateboarding as a sport and its positive impact on young people.</p>
        <h5>women skaters</h5>
        <p>Skateboarding has always been a male-dominated sport. While the precise percentage of women skaters is unclear, some statistics estimate as lower as 9% female participation ranging to 25%. It’s shocking that this number is so low, given the contributions that women have made to the evolution of skateboarding. Patti McGee, the first professional women’s skater, was internationally known in the 60s for her speed and handstand tricks and one of the original Z-Boys was a woman named Peggy Oki, now a painter and environmental activist.</p>
        <p>Though underrepresented on the whole, women are the fastest growing segment of skateboarders today. Many initiatives like the Girls Skate Network the Women’s Skateboarding Alliance have formed to support both professional and amateur skaters and encourage female participation in the sport. The crux of the issue lies in skate competitions. While women have a substantial presence in street skating, there is a dearth of women in skateboarding competitions. This isn’t for a lack of participation, however. Women struggle to gain sponsorship from the major skate brands and have been pushed out of many of the major skate competitions. The lack of visibility of women skaters has been attributed to both the larger skate companies (Vans dropped its sponsorship of multiple female skaters and the X Games removed Women’s Vert Skateboarding as a category in 2011) and also the pressures of female skaters to both shred and look sexy. Most portrayals of women in skate magazines are not skaters, but models posing with boards.</p>

          <p>Hi Dad,</p>
          <p>Coming into this new space, I have been trying to take up as little room possible. At a skatepark, everyone is as much focused on their own tricks as they are on watching what the other boarders are up to. While I know that they’re watching others with curious eyes, it’s difficult for me to hobble around on my board without feeling like I am being judged. Because of this, I spend much of my time at the park observing others. I have learned that when someone lands a sweet trick you should slam your board on the ground in a round of applause. Sometimes, if you’re really impressed you’ll just throw the board. This all seems pretty counterintuitive to me, as I have been trying to keep my board in as pristine a condition as possible. For a culture that so values style and appearance, I found it unusual that so many skaters were manhandling their boards. But I suppose skate culture is also about attitude and being “extreme” so maybe that’s where it comes from. I don’t know, and honestly most assessments I have been making on skateboarding and skate culture seem naïve and oversimplified.</p>
          <p>Learning the language here has been somewhat of a challenge. The vocabulary is relatively simple and easily translatable, however mimicking the intonations of other skaters feels so unnatural. These words sound wrong in my voice and the six safety pads I have strapped to my body look awkward to match.</p>
          <p>I am the only beginner I ever see at the park. This is discouraging because I constantly feel isolated and so much worse than the others (including many children). However, I also get a lot of special attention because of this. The community is so friendly and offers genuinely helpful advice. In the very beginning, I thought I could at least look the part, even if I had no experience. When I got to the park and received a bunch of safety pads and a fluorescent helmet, I knew it would be more than apparent that I was a newbie. My nugget of advice when learning this sport is to wear safety guards. The floor of a skatepark is intentionally frictionless and the cement is unforgiving. By wearing safety guards, I was less afraid of falling and learned faster as a result. In these early stages, I’m realizing that this is just as much a mental task as it is physical. Fear of falling and looking dumb has stopped me from committing to tricks and in turn, caused many falls. Each time I leave the park, I feel like I didn’t push myself as much as I would have liked. I hope to get to a point with skateboarding where I am comfortable enough to try moves at faster speeds, as this seems to be my number one barrier right now.</p>
          <p>I honestly thought I was doing well and learning pretty quickly. My skate instructor, Josh, keeps assuring me on my progress, but I think he’s just trying to make me feel better. It’s embarrassing and discouraging to see yourself look so uncoordinated and awkward on camera, especially when in that moment you felt like you were actually getting it. I can recognize that it’s all part of the process and that these videos of myself are comedy gold, but I am frustrated and saddened by my slow progress.</p>
          <p>I generally pride myself on my ability to pick up new physical skills with relative ease, but my board is not budging. I long for aerials where I can control and isolate each individual body part at my will. Aerials are about awareness and holding muscles in specific positions, but skateboarding is much different. It’s fluid and loose and I am tense and focused. I can’t get out of my mind long enough to just ride the board. I’m stuck in a cycle of thinking, tensing and wiping out. Thank god for my own personal cheer squad: Josh, his adorable six-year old son and the rest of the dudes at the park (by the way, I am the only girl there). I feel like I am failing women everywhere with my lack of skills, but the guys at RAD Skatepark are to my surprise, extremely supportive and welcoming.</p>
          <p>Josh, in particular, has played a huge role in my development as a skateboarder. He has claimed that “skateboarding saved his life” and that he wouldn’t have his son if it weren’t for skateboarding. When I step off the board during a trick because I’ve lost my balance, he’ll usually respond with “Good Decision!” Josh says its amazing that I feel so comfortable stepping off when I feel unbalanced, as many beginner boarders can feel glued to the board and then just wipe out and hurt themselves. While I think there is a lot of validity to Josh’s words, I’m taking advantage of these “good decisions” all too much. I’m realizing that my intuition is caution when learning these moves. I’m frustrated in seeing this in myself and can’t tell if I’m upset about my lack of ability or the slow learning speed, though I’m sure they are very interconnected. Regardless, this frustrated is minimal in comparison to the excitement I find in learning each move. Josh warned (bragged?) that skateboarding is addictive and can become a way of life, but I think I’m more addicted to the thrill and empowerment of learning new abilities than I am attached to skateboarding itself.</p>

    <h4 id="sleuthing" class="subtitle">SLEUTHING</h4>
      <h5>history</h5>
        <p>While there is not much on record about the history of amateur sleuthing as a practice, many of its techniques are inspired by police detective work and fictional depictions of amateur sleuths. Web sleuthing took form in the late 1990’s and is the most documented form of amateur sleuthing. Amateurs will gather on forums such as the Doe Network and WebSleuths to match unidentified remains with missing person reports.</p>
        <p>One of the first cases solved by a web sleuth was the identification of a Jane Doe found dead in Kentucky in 1968. Named “Tent Girl” because her body was found wrapped in a canvas tent, Barbara Ann Hackman Taylor would go unidentified until January 1998. Todd Matthews had learned about the case from his father-in-law and became obsessed with finding her identity. He created websites, searched classifieds and missing person reports. Web sleuthing originally took form in Yahoo! groups, where some of the earliest sleuths, like Troy More created newsgroups dedicated to the missing, murdered and unidentified. Matthews sifted groups like these to identify Tent Girl. As the web became more user-friendly, entire forums were created for web sleuths. Most of the moderators of these groups were the creators of the original Yahoo! groups. Today, the most popular forum is WebSleuths, which has been used as a tool in solving countless missing person cases and has contributed to some murder convictions.</p>
      <h5>web sleuthing</h5>
        <p>While amateur sleuths can be pivotal in solving some cases, they are often wrong and can bog down police departments with false leads. Additionally, there has been some controversy of the effects that web sleuths have on victim’s families. Often these sleuths are driven by some competitive edge or game and lack the sensitivity required when reaching out to family members of the missing.</p>
      <h5>letter</h5>
        <p>Hi Mom,</p>
        <p>I feel quite lost and unequipped in this world. While the world of detective work is well-defined, the sub-community of amateur detective work is hazy and unregulated. My initial interactions with amateur sleuthing were all through fictional depictions in books and on television. While these sources are fantastic inspiration and entertainment, they are entirely unrepresentative of reality’s amateur sleuths. Most modern day sleuths work from behind a computer, usually late at night, gathering news articles and posting on forums. Today’s sleuths make the most substantial impact on identifying missing persons. While I hoped for ciphers, interrogations and seemingly magical forensic techniques, I am most deeply fascinated by the community that makes up today’s sleuths.</p>
        <p>When first approaching this skill, I immediately began reading about the modern day techniques of police detectives and private investigators, as there was the most online documentation about this and it felt in line with the techniques I had seen on television. I began immersing myself in forensic practices and methods for tailing subjects, however I realized that none of these skills could be used in a meaningful way without the support of expensive equipment, access to privatized data and the legal right to conduct a case. Though this community was welcoming and I was able to interview professionals, my relationship with the topic was extremely limited and without schooling and training was likely to stay that way. I realized I had to pivot to where today’s amateur sleuths are – the Internet.</p> 
        <p>I have barely begun to get to know what today’s sleuths are up to. My best bet is to use the online forums to try to make contact with someone. I have found this to be very difficult, as the community is at first glance exclusive, paranoid and skeptical. I’ve only lingered on the site as a reader and frankly am not sure how one would use this forum to identify a body. These online forums, particularly Web Sleuths, are crowded and confusing, with little guidance on how to use. Each case seems to be a collection of links to various news articles, court documents and images that may or may not be relevant to the case. Within each case are hundreds of threads about aspects of the case. When I look at one of these pages I feel overwhelmed and unsure how to decipher relevant vs. irrelevant information. I wish that there were a reference I could reach out to because blindly messaging other users has been unsuccessful. Amateur sleuthing is much less romantic and glamorous than I had initially envisioned, but I find a lot of joy in trying to understand not only how one would use the internet to connect a body to an identity, but also the type of person that would become so invested in a case where they are both distant from the physical evidence of the case and uncredited.</p>
